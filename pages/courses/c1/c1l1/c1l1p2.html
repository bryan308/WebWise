                                HTTP is the web's foundation. When you click on a link, it loads the webpage. This protocol allows devices
                                to interact across networks. Basically, the device you're using requests a webpage, and the server sends it.
                                Simple as that!

                                The creators of the Internet needed to overcome the challenge of connecting computers with
                                different hardware and software. They solved this by establishing standardized protocols, which are sets of
                                rules for communication and data formatting. These protocols include Ethernet for local network communication,
                                IP for inter-network communication, TCP for ensuring packet delivery and order, and HTTP for formatting data for
                                websites and applications. Additionally, there are protocols for routing, testing, encryption, and alternative
                                protocols like UDP for streaming video. These standardized protocols enable all Internet-connected devices to
                                communicate effectively, regardless of their differences.

                                A crucial part of the internet is the Domain Name System (DNS). In simple terms, it functions as a translator
                                between numerical IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.2, and human-friendly domain names, such as nytimes.com, that
                                computers use to talk to one another. Each internet-connected gadget has an own IP address. In order for a
                                website to know where to send your request when you put in its address, DNS servers manage the process of
                                connecting domain names to these IP addresses. It helps user navigation on the internet by acting as a virtual

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                The process of converting domain names, such as www.GOOGLE.com, into IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, is
                                known as DNS resolution. An IP address can be used to find an internet-connected device, just like a street
                                address does. Your browser silently performs an DNS search in the background when you type the name of a
                                website, converting the name into the correct address. It is completely automatic so the user doesn't need
                                to be involved!

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                A domain name serves as a shortcut to a website's actual address, which is a collection of digits known as
                                an IP address. Instead of inputting those digits, simply type the domain name in your browser, such as
                                "GOOGLE.COM" for Google. DNS (Domain Name System) works behind the scenes to translate the domain name into
                                an IP address, allowing you to access the correct website. It works similarly to a digital address book on
                                the internet!

                                are stored on a physical server that is managed by a web host after you pay for a hosting plan. They take
                                care of everything, from maintaining the server's performance to ensuring the security of your website. To

                                the browser is the client that runs on a computer and contacts the web server to request for information. The

                                This passage explains the concept of packets in computer networking. It compares the process
                                of sending data over the internet in packets to the construction of the Statue of Liberty, where the statue was
                                shipped in pieces and assembled at its destination. Packets contain data and a header specifying how to handle
                                the data. They are routed independently by networking devices like routers and switches, allowing for efficient
                                transmission. Packet switching enables multiple users to utilize the internet simultaneously without
                                overwhelming the network.
