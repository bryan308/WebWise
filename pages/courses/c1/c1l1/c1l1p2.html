                                Isn't the internet a vast network of connections? Well, routers and switches are the hidden heroes who make
                                it all possible. Routers transmit data between networks, while switches keep things running smoothly within
                                a single network. They work together to let our computers to communicate and retrieve information stored on
                                remote servers.

                                The creators of the Internet needed to overcome the challenge of connecting computers with
                                different hardware and software. They solved this by establishing standardized protocols, which are sets of
                                rules for communication and data formatting. These protocols include Ethernet for local network communication,
                                IP for inter-network communication, TCP for ensuring packet delivery and order, and HTTP for formatting data for
                                websites and applications. Additionally, there are protocols for routing, testing, encryption, and alternative
                                protocols like UDP for streaming video. These standardized protocols enable all Internet-connected devices to
                                communicate effectively, regardless of their differences.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                This passage explains the concept of packets in computer networking. It compares the process of sending data over the
                                internet in packets to the construction of the Statue of Liberty, where the statue was shipped in pieces and assembled
                                at its destination. Packets contain data and a header specifying how to handle the data. They are routed independently
                                by networking devices like routers and switches, allowing for efficient transmission. Packet switching enables multiple
                                users to utilize the internet simultaneously without overwhelming the network.

                                content using storing, processing, and distributing webpages. In addition to HTTP, web servers handle protocols
                                such as SMTP for email and FTP for file transmission. Consider it the ultimate multitasker of the internet

                                HTTP is the web's foundation. When you click on a link, it loads the webpage. This protocol allows devices
                                to interact across networks. Basically, the device you're using requests a webpage, and the server sends it.
                                Simple as that!

                                A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) sometimes termed a Web Address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies
                                its location on a computer network or the internet. These URLs or URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are transferred
                                to web servers for requests to specific web documents or HTML pages.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                URL can be likened to an address in real life. Just as an address identifies the location of a physical building or place,
                                a URL identifies the location of a specific resource on the internet, such as a web page, image, video, or document.

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a vital role on the internet, essentially serving as a translator between
                                comprehensible domain names, like nytimes.com, and numerical IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.2, that computers
                                understand. Every internet-linked device has its own IP address. DNS servers are responsible for connecting
                                domain names to these IP addresses, guiding the process that ensures your request reaches the correct website
                                when you enter its address. In essence, DNS functions as a digital phone book for seamless internet navigation.

                                The process of converting domain names, such as www.GOOGLE.com, into IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, is
                                known as DNS resolution. An IP address can be used to find an internet-connected device, just like a street
                                address does. Your browser silently performs an DNS search in the background when you type the name of a
                                website, converting the name into the correct address. It is completely automatic so the user doesn't need
                                to be involved!

                                A domain name is a website's equivalent to a physical address. It consists of a name and an 
                                <span class="sec-hl">extension</span>. It helps users easily find your website and eliminates 
                                the need to memorize the site's internet protocol (IP) address. On top of all, domain names are key to the

                                are stored on a physical server that is managed by a web host after you pay for a hosting plan. They take
                                care of everything, from maintaining the server's performance to ensuring the security of your website. To

                                        information in form of text, audio, images, and videos from all around the world. Mozilla Firefox was developed by 
                                        Mozilla Foundation in 2002 under the Phoenix community. Nowadays, it is called Firefox only as it is derived from

                                        The original Opera web browser was released in 1995, as the result of a research project of a Norwegian telecommunications 
                                        company. Since that time, the browser has received multitudes of updates in response to new innovations, and to keep pace 
                                        with new technological innovations. Opera has a fast development cycle and experiments with new features and updates every 
                                        two weeks.

                                        Microsoft Edge has undergone a transformation, moving away from its proprietary technology to rebuild itself on the Chromium 
                                        foundation, which powers Google Chrome. With Microsoft's optimizations and added features, it offers a compelling browsing 
                                        experience. Initially launched as Project Spartan to replace Internet Explorer, the original Edge lacked popularity compared 
                                        to Chrome. However, the revamped Edge aims to compete more effectively in the browser market.

                                        Safari is the default web browser for Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, and macOS. It was initially released in 2003 
                                        and was available on Windows until 2012. Safari's popularity increased with the rise of iPhone and iPad, and it now holds 
                                        about 54% of the mobile browser market share in the US. It allows users to browse websites, save favorites, and open multiple 
                                        tabs. Safari is built using the WebKit engine and was one of the first to support HTML5. The latest versions for macOS and iOS 
                                        are 11.1 and 12.1 respectively, with features to prevent cross-site tracking.

                                        Brave is a free web browser that launched in 2016 with the intention of protecting users' privacy, blocking online advertisements, 
                                        and rewarding website owners with cryptocurrency payments.

                                        In early 2017, Brave launched its own cryptocurrency token, <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/" class="pri-link">Basic 
                                        Attention Token (BAT)</a>, which is used to make payments. Later that same year, Brave began to expand beyond supporting websites 
                                        to share BAT payments with YouTube and Twitch video creators. In late 2018, Brave announced plans to enable BAT tipping to post 
                                        creators on Twitter and Reddit.
