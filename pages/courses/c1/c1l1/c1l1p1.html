                                Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting
                                via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
                                client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks In a broader sense, web
                                development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to build, maintain and manage a
                                website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are optimal. It might also, but not necessarily,
                                include all those strategic actions needed to ensure its proper ranking on search engine results. Usually, those
                                tasks pertain to a different specialization, namely search engine optimization (SEO).

                            <p class="paragraph"> 
                                Webpages have come a long way since the late 1980s when Tim Berners-Lee kickstarted the global hypertext project, birthing 
                                the World Wide Web in 1991. The release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 made accessing webpages easier, sparking a surge 
                                in creation. To preserve this digital history, the Internet Archive, founded in 1996, hosts the Wayback Machine since 2001, 
                                allowing users to revisit archived webpage versions. Today, webpages incorporate various technologies like HTML, CSS, and 
                                JavaScript, evolving in design and functionality to meet technological advancements and user expectations.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                In 1989, <span class="secondary-highlight">Tim Berners-Lee</span> proposed the idea for the
                                World Wide Web in a document titled "Information Management: A Proposal." Initially met with skepticism, his
                                boss at the time described the proposal as "Vague but exciting." However, <span class="secondary-highlight">Tim</span> was granted
                                time to work on the project, and by 1990, he had
                                developed the foundational technologies of the web: <span class="primary-highlight">HTML</span>, <span class="primary-highlight">URI
                                    (or URL)</span>, and <span class="primary-highlight">HTTP</span>. He also
                                created the first web browser and server. Recognizing the importance of openness for the web's success, <span
                                    class="secondary-highlight">Tim</span> advocated for making its underlying code available royalty-free,
                                which was agreed upon by CERN in <span class="secondary-highlight">1993</span>. This decision fostered
                                widespread creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Tim later founded the <span class="secondary-highlight">World
                                    Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</span> at MIT in 1994 to develop open web
                                standards, a role he still holds today.
