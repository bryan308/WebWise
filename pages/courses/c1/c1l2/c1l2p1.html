                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Computer programmers encounter a lot of technical terms and jargon, which can be overwhelming for beginners. Troubleshooting and debugging 
                                are two crucial concepts that new programmers need to understand and distinguish from each other.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                While debugging is a more time-consuming 
                                process, troubleshooting is a more frequent task that programmers perform. However, both skills are essential for efficient and effective 
                                software development.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="article-header">What is Troubleshooting?</h3>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Troubleshooting is a process that involves identifying and isolating issues within a system. It is a broader process than debugging and can be applied to any system, from 
                                complex technological systems to everyday tasks like doing laundry.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                When troubleshooting, it is important to interview end users to understand the steps they took that 
                                led to the problem, and then attempt to identify the source of the issue. This process may involve simple solutions like turning on the water or plugging in the dryer, or 
                                it may require more in-depth analysis and repair.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="article-header">What is Debugging?</h3>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Debugging is a specific type of troubleshooting that focuses on identifying and resolving issues within computer code. As a programmer, debugging involves locating the 
                                source of the problem and making necessary repairs. However, this process can be complex and challenging, especially when there are multiple potential points of failure 
                                or when the issue is not immediately apparent.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                For instance, it may seem like the problem lies with the JavaScript code in a browser, but in reality, the issue could be 
                                with the web server. Additionally, when servers are hosted in a third-party cloud environment, the debugging process can be further complicated by new sets of challenges.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="article-header">What is the difference between troubleshooting and debugging?</h3>
                            <p class="paragraph">
                                Troubleshooting and debugging are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Troubleshooting may not always lead to a 
                                solution at the time of identification, due to procedural constraints or workflow protocols. Debugging, on the other hand, aims to discover 
                                and fix a problem in the same session. As the industry evolves, programmer roles are changing, and developers are taking on more 
                                troubleshooting tasks. This shift is driven by the adoption of DevOps practices, which can eliminate the need for an operations department.

                                The excerpt emphasizes the significance of continuous learning in the constantly evolving field of web development. It underscores the benefits of expanding one's 
                                knowledge and skills to tackle complex projects, adapt to new technologies, and create innovative solutions. Continuous learning can also foster personal and professional

                                The excerpt encourages developers to embrace lifelong learning through various means, such as attending conferences, workshops, and online courses, and joining online 
                                communities to learn from others. Web development can be challenging to learn, especially for beginners, and it is common to get stuck on a problem and give up. However, 
                                with persistence and a commitment to learning, developers can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.
