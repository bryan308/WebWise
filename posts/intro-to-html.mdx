### Introduction

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is an essential building block of every web page. HTML's primary purpose is to list the content used in the web page. HTML wll display text, labels, lists, insert photos and other media, create hyperlinks, buttons, and containers. This is all done with appropriate HTML elements.

Additionally, each HTML elements can be used to separate content into sections. You can also nest HTML elements with one another for better control over the page layouts and content.

### Elements

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and uses Elements that are made up of tags. Tags are easy to recognize as they use angle brackets (`<` and `>`).

<Card
	variant='notes'
	header='Take note'
>
	For now, we will use `<p></p>` as our primary element that represents as a paragraph, we will explain
	it further after some lessons.
</Card>

**Opening tags** use angle brackets `<>` and a keyword inside, like `<p>` for paragraph.

**Closing tags** look similar to opening tags, but with a forward slash before the keyword, like `</p>` to end the paragraph.

```html
<p>Content here</p>
```
