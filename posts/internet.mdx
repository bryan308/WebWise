### Introduction

The **Internet** is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both connected to the Internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of languages called **Protocols**.

### How does the internet work?

Isn't the internet a vast network of connections? Well, routers and switches are the hidden heroes who make it all possible. Routers transmit data between networks, while switches keep things running smoothly within a single network. They work together to let our computers to communicate and retrieve information stored on remote servers.

### Protocols

The creators of the Internet needed to overcome the challenge of connecting computers with different hardware and software. They solved this by establishing standardized protocols, which are sets of rules for communication and data formatting. These protocols include Ethernet for local network communication, IP for inter-network communication, TCP for ensuring packet delivery and order, and HTTP for formatting data for websites and applications. Additionally, there are protocols for routing, testing, encryption, and alternative protocols like UDP for streaming video. These standardized protocols enable all Internet-connected devices to communicate effectively, regardless of their differences.

### Packets

This passage explains the concept of packets in computer networking. It compares the process of sending data over the internet in packets to the construction of the Statue of Liberty, where the statue was shipped in pieces and assembled at its destination. Packets contain data and a header specifying how to handle the data. They are routed independently by networking devices like routers and switches, allowing for efficient transmission. Packet switching enables multiple users to utilize the internet simultaneously without overwhelming the network.

### Web Servers

**Web Server** acts as the internet's powerhouse, responding to requests from users all around the web using HTTP and other protocols. Its important job? Providing website content using storing, processing, and distributing webpages. In addition to HTTP, web servers handle protocols such as SMTP for email and FTP for file transmission. Consider it the ultimate multitasker of the internet world!.

### HTTP

HTTP is the web's foundation. When you click on a link, it loads the webpage. This protocol allows devices to interact across networks. Basically, the device you're using requests a webpage, and the server sends it. Simple as that!

### URL

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) sometimes termed a Web Address, is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network or the internet. These URLs or URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are transferred to web servers for requests to specific web documents or HTML pages.

URL can be likened to an address in real life. Just as an address identifies the location of a physical building or place, a URL identifies the location of a specific resource on the internet, such as a web page, image, video, or document.

### What is DNS?

The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a vital role on the internet, essentially serving as a translator between comprehensible domain names, like nytimes.com, and numerical IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.2, that computers understand. Every internet-linked device has its own IP address. DNS servers are responsible for connecting domain names to these IP addresses, guiding the process that ensures your request reaches the correct website when you enter its address. In essence, DNS functions as a digital phone book for seamless internet navigation.

</Section>

<Section>

### How DNS Work?

The process of converting domain names, such as www.GOOGLE.com, into IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, is known as DNS resolution. An IP address can be used to find an internet-connected device, just like a street address does. Your browser silently performs an DNS search in the background when you type the name of a website, converting the name into the correct address. It is completely automatic so the user doesn't need to be involved!

### What is Domain Name?

A domain name is a website's equivalent to a physical address. It consists of a name and an **extension**. It helps users easily find your website and eliminates the need to memorize the site's internet protocol (IP) address. On top of all, domain names are key to the internet infrastructure.

**These are the example domain names:**

- `.com` - Commercial Site
- `.gov` - Government SIte
- `.edu` - Educational Institution Site
- `.net` - Network Site
- `.org` - Organizational Site
- `.biz` - Business Site
- `.mil` - Military Site

### What is Web Hosting?

Buying room on the internet for your website is similar to web hosting. The files and data for your website are stored on a physical server that is managed by a web host after you pay for a hosting plan. They take care of everything, from maintaining the server's performance to ensuring the security of your website. To put it quickly they ensure that visitors to your website will safely and easily access it.

### Web Browsers

A Web Browser or simply Browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including web pages, images, videos, and other files. As a client/server model, the browser is the client that runs on a computer and contacts the web server to request for information. The web server sends the information back to the browser which displays the results on the computer or other internet enabled device that supports a browser.
**This is the list of the browser that you can use**

- **Google Chrome**

With Microsoft's optimizations and added features, it offers a compelling browsing experience. Initially launched as Project Spartan to replace Internet Explorer, the original Edge lacked popularity compared to Chrome. However, the revamped Edge aims to compete more effectively in the browser market.

- **Safari Browser**
