### Operating System

An operating system is a crucial software that manages a computer's resources, including memory and processing power, and enables you to interact with the computer without needing to understand its technical details. Without an operating system, a computer would be ineffective.

### The Operating System's Job

The operating system (OS) manages computer hardware and software resources, ensuring that multiple programs run smoothly and efficiently. It allocates CPU, memory, and storage to each program, ensuring they receive the necessary resources to function properly.

### Examples of Operating System

- **Microsoft Windows** <br />
  Windows is a graphical operating system developed by Microsoft. It allows users to view and store files, run the software, play games, watch videos, and provides a way to connect to the internet. It was released for both home computing and professional works.

- **MacOS** <br />
  MacOS is the operating system that powers every Mac. It lets you do things you simply can't with other computers. That's because it's designed specifically for the hardware it runs on — and vice versa. macOS comes with an entire suite of beautifully designed apps. It works hand in hand with iCloud to keep photos, documents, and other stuff up to date on all your devices. It makes your Mac work like magic with your iPhone and other Apple devices. And it's been built from the ground up with privacy and security in mind.

- **Linux** <br />
  Linux® is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

Computer programmers encounter a lot of technical terms and jargon, which can be overwhelming for beginners. Troubleshooting and debugging are two crucial concepts that new programmers need to understand and distinguish from each other.

While debugging is a more time-consuming process, troubleshooting is a more frequent task that programmers perform. However, both skills are essential for efficient and effective software development.

### What is Troubleshooting?

Troubleshooting is a process that involves identifying and isolating issues within a system. It is a broader process than debugging and can be applied to any system, from complex technological systems to everyday tasks like doing laundry.

When troubleshooting, it is important to interview end users to understand the steps they took that led to the problem, and then attempt to identify the source of the issue. This process may involve simple solutions like turning on the water or plugging in the dryer, or it may require more in-depth analysis and repair.

### What is Debugging?

Debugging is a specific type of troubleshooting that focuses on identifying and resolving issues within computer code. As a programmer, debugging involves locating the source of the problem and making necessary repairs. However, this process can be complex and challenging, especially when there are multiple potential points of failure or when the issue is not immediately apparent.

For instance, it may seem like the problem lies with the JavaScript code in a browser, but in reality, the issue could be with the web server. Additionally, when servers are hosted in a third-party cloud environment, the debugging process can be further complicated by new sets of challenges.

### What is the difference between troubleshooting and debugging?

Troubleshooting and debugging are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Troubleshooting may not always lead to a solution at the time of identification, due to procedural constraints or workflow protocols. Debugging, on the other hand, aims to discover and fix a problem in the same session. As the industry evolves, programmer roles are changing, and developers are taking on more troubleshooting tasks. This shift is driven by the adoption of DevOps practices, which can eliminate the need for an operations department.

### Continues Learning

The excerpt emphasizes the significance of continuous learning in the constantly evolving field of web development. It underscores the benefits of expanding one's knowledge and skills to tackle complex projects, adapt to new technologies, and create innovative solutions. Continuous learning can also foster personal and professional growth, enhancing confidence and problem-solving abilities.

The excerpt encourages developers to embrace lifelong learning through various means, such as attending conferences, workshops, and online courses, and joining online communities to learn from others. Web development can be challenging to learn, especially for beginners, and it is common to get stuck on a problem and give up. However, with persistence and a commitment to learning, developers can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.
