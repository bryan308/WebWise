### Introduction
The Web Development Life Cycle is a systematic process that web developers follow to create a website or web application. It consists of several phases, each with its own set of activities and goals.

1. **Planning** <br />
   During the Planning phase, the main objective is to define the purpose, goals, and scope of the project. Developers identify project stakeholders, establish project timelines and milestones, develop a budget, and conduct a feasibility study to secure necessary resources.
2. **Analysis** <br />
   In the Analysis phase, the focus shifts to understanding and documenting detailed project requirements. Information about user needs and expectations is gathered, user personas and use cases are created, and existing systems are analyzed to determine necessary features and functionalities.
3. **Design** <br />
   Moving on to the Design phase, the goal is to create a blueprint of the web application based on the gathered requirements. This involves designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), creating wireframes and prototypes, defining the system architecture, and planning for security measures.
4. **Development** <br />
   In the Development phase, the emphasis is on transforming the design into actual code and building a functional web application. Developers write code using programming languages and frameworks, develop the database, and integrate it with the application, while also implementing the designed UI/UX.
5. **Testing** <br />
   Testing becomes crucial in the Testing phase to ensure the quality and functionality of the web application. Rigorous testing is conducted to identify and fix bugs, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
6. **Implementation** <br />
   During the Implementation phase, the web application is deployed to the production environment. This involves setting up hosting, transferring the codebase and database, and addressing any issues that arise during the deployment process.
7. **Maintenance** <br />
   Finally, in the Maintenance phase, the focus is on sustaining and improving the web application over time. Ongoing support and troubleshooting are provided, updates and enhancements are made based on user feedback, performance and security are monitored, and bugs are addressed and patches applied as needed.
