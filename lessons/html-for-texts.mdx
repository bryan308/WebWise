### Introduction
Understanding HTML text elements is crucial since much web content is text-based. This lesson will explore fundamental text elements used in web development.

### Line break tag
Since you already know the basic structure of a webpage, let's now try to put contents in the webpage. Again, to show the contents in a webpage you need to put the contents inside the `<body>` and `</body>` tags.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello! This is the first line.
    Hello! This is the second line.
    Hello! This is the third line.
  </body>
</html>
```
### Output:
<MDXImage 
  src='/images/lesson-images/l3/output-1.png'
  alt='output-1'
  width={400}
  height={121}
/>
In HTML, by default, consecutive lines of text are displayed without line breaks. In other words, multiple spaces, tabs, and line breaks in the HTML code are collapsed into a single space when rendered in the browser. Therefore, even though we have placed each line of text on a separate line in the HTML code, they appear as a single continuous line in the browser.

To create a new line in the rendered output, we need to use the line break tag `<br />` after each line of text that we want to appear on a new line. Let's modify the HTML code to include line break tags:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello! This is the first line.<br />
    Hello! This is the second line.<br />
    Hello! This is the third line.<br />
  </body>
</html>
```
### Output:
<MDXImage 
  src='/images/lesson-images/l3/br-output.png'
  alt='break line output'
  width={400}
  height={225}
/>
</Section>

### Paragraph
In HTML, the `<p>` defines the start of the paragraph and the `</p>` defines the end.
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
**The defaults of the paragraphs:**
- The font size is **16px** (pixels).
- The alignment is **left aligned**.
- The font family is **Times New Roman**.
- There is a margin of space around the top and the bottom of each paragraph that is typically **1em** or equivalent to **16px**.

Paragraph `<p>` can be nested, for now there is no magical like happening but in some later lessons you will appriciate them.
```html
<p>
This is a paragraph.
  <p>
    This is the first nested paragraph.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the second nested paragraph.
    <p>
      This is a nested paragraph in a nested paragraph.
    </p>
  </p>
</p>
```
### Output:
<MDXImage 
  src='/images/lesson-images/l3/nested-paragraph-output.png'
  alt='nested paragraph output'
  width={400}
  height={225}
/>
The result explains the behavior of **block elements**, each of the `<p>` tags occupy a whole line, and the spacing above and below them is constant.

### Headings
The HTML heading elements are very important when determining the style and structure of text within web pages.

There are six section heading elements, `<h1></h1>` to `<h6></h6>`. `<h1>` being the largest size by default and most important by search engines. `<h6>` being the smallest and least important of the text headings within a web page.
<Card variant='tips'>
- Search enginges will not penalize multiple uses of `<h1>`, but one use of an `<h1>` per page is often preferred. Multiple uses of all the other headings are common and encouraged.
- By default, the `<h4>` heading is the same size as the `<p>`, which is **16px**.
- Don't skip heading sequences, like using `<h1>` and then an `<h3>`. You'll only want to use `<h3>` if you both have `<h1>` & `<h2>` on the page.
