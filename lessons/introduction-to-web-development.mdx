### Overview

Web development encompasses the tasks involved in creating and maintaining websites for hosting via intranet or internet. This includes web design, content development, scripting, and network security configuration. In a broader sense, web development involves all actions, updates, and operations to ensure optimal performance, user experience, and speed. It may also involve search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure proper ranking on search engine results.

### History of Web

Webpages have come a long way since the late 1980s when Tim Berners-Lee kickstarted the global hypertext project, birthing the World Wide Web in 1991. The release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 made accessing webpages easier, sparking a surge in creation. To preserve this digital history, the Internet Archive, founded in 1996, hosts the Wayback Machine since 2001, allowing users to revisit archived webpage versions. Today, webpages incorporate various technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, evolving in design and functionality to meet technological advancements and user expectations.

In 1989, **Tim Berners-Lee** proposed the idea for the World Wide Web in a document titled "Information Management: A Proposal." Initially met with skepticism, his boss at the time described the proposal as "Vague but exciting." However, **Tim** was granted time to work on the project, and by 1990, he had developed the foundational technologies of the web: `HTML`, `URI (or URL)`, and `HTTP`. He also created the first web browser and server. Recognizing the importance of openness for the web's success, **Tim** advocated for making its underlying code available royalty-free, which was agreed upon by CERN in **1993**. This decision fostered widespread creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Tim later founded the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** at MIT in 1994 to develop open web standards, a role he still holds today.

Sir **Tim Berners-Lee** is a British computer scientist. He was born in London, and his parents were early computer scientists, working on one of the earliest computers.

### Core Areas of Web Development

The web development world has different specializatoins, each with its unique focus. We'll introduce you to the three main areas:

- **Frontend Development**: This is all about creating the user interface and user experience - the visual elements and fundtionalities that users interact with on a website.
- **Backend Development**: Working begind the scenes, backend developers build the server-side logic and manage databases that make everything tick. They ensure websites function smoothly and efficiently.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Full-Stack developers are the ultimate jacks-of-all-trades, possessing skills in both frontend and backend development. They can tackle all aspects of a web project!
